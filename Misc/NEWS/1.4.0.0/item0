Split Program to 3 Editions to hep me get EC for the Game. The Editons are "Free", "Pro" (30$ EC code), and "Ultimate" (50$ EC Code). Free is just like it says, it is free but you can only mod UI koms. Pro you can only mod UI koms and Costumes. On Ultimate however you can mod any kom you want as long as that kom isnt protected (This would help me determine what koms are protected and what arent). Note: I hate to do this but at this moment I am so poor and same in Game, this way I could get things I like / want in the game or I could do giveaways or I could sell EC from it at prob like 5.5:100~6:100.
